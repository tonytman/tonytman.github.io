## Electrodiagnostic signals

### Standard protocol

#### Full-field electroretinogram (ffERG)

##### Overview

ffERG evaluate the global retinal function in two adaptation setups. In dark adapted setup, patients are required to dark adapted for at least 20 minutes for rod-dominated retinal electrophysiological assessment. In light adapted setup, patients are required to light adapt for at least 10 minutes for cone-dominated retinal electrophysiological assessment. Despite the adaptation, signal responses do not completely exclude, but supress the complementary rod or cone signal contribution.

##### Normal waveform

##### Dark adapted flash response with stimulation intensity of $0.01 \ Cd.s.m^{-2}$

##### Dark adapted flash response with stimulation intensity of $3 \ Cd.s.m^{-2}$

##### Dark adapted flash oscillatory response with stimulation intensity of $3 \ Cd.s.m^{-2}$

##### Dark adapted flash response with stimulation intensity of $10 \ Cd.s.m^{-2}$

##### Light adapted flash response with stimulation intensity of $3 \ Cd.s.m^{-2}$

##### Light adapted flicker response with stimulation intensity of $3 \ Cd.s.m^{-2}$

#### Pattern reversal electroretinogram

#### Pattern reversal Visual Evoked Potential

#### Electrooculogram

### Extended protocol

## Recognised disorder

### Macular origin

#### Stargargt disease

#### Bull's eye maculopathy

#### Best Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy

#### Occult Macular Dystrophy

### Retinal origin

#### Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB)

#### X-linked Juvenile Retinoschisis

#### Retinitis Pigmentosa

#### Glaucoma

##### Clinical features

Usually discovered by reduction in visual field with background of high introocular pressure. Common sign include optic atrophy and retinal nerve fibre layer thinning.

##### Diagnostic finding

Reduced amplitude and delayed peak time are reported in the Photopic negative response and prERG-N95 waveform. Such observations reflecting retinal ganglion cell disorder.

##### Progression monitoring

#### Toxicity

### Postretinal origin

#### Amblyopia

#### Optic nerve demylination

#### Optic neuritis

## Unknown observation

#### Visual acuity loss

##### Clinical identification

Visual acuity loss can easily be detected by visual acuity test.

##### Primary presumption

Visual acuity generally reflect the cone dominated visual pathway. Thus loss in visual acuity loss is presumably induced by macular disorder or visual pathway disease.

##### Electrodiagnostic test

Both macular function and optic nerve should be accessed.

#### Nyctalopia

#### Photophobia

#### Monochromacy

#### Cherry red fovea

#### Disk pallor

##### Clinical identification

Disk pallor can be identified by fundus photos. The optic disk will be pale.

##### Primary presumption

Presumeably a feature of optic neuropathy or retinopathy.

##### Electrodiagnostic test

#### Ocular media opacity

##### Clinical identification
##### Primary presumption
##### Electrodiagnostic test
